DHTMLX Connector for Java
========================

dhtmlxConnector is an extension for the DHTMLX library, which maps client-side 
components onto the server-side datasource. Supported components are:

  * [dhtmlxTree](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxTree/index.shtml)
  * [dhtmlxGrid](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/index.shtml)
  * [dhtmlxTreeGrid](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxTreeGrid/index.shtml)
  * [dhtmlxCombo](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxCombo/index.shtml)
  * [dhtmlxDataView](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxDataView/index.shtml)
  * [dhtmlxScheduler](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/index.shtml)
  * [dhtmlx touch](http://dhtmlx.com/touch/)

You don't need to worry about data formats any more. dhtmlxConnector will handle
data connections between the server-side database and client-side components,
seamlessly loading content. When integrated with dhtmlxDataProcessor on the 
client side, dhtmlxConnector also takes care of update/insert/delete operations.

It organizes server-side functionality to support special modes for components 
working with large amounts of data (such as dynamic loading, Smart Rendering, 
and paging) as well as server-side sorting and filtering.
